This file contains examples of how to use each worker and notes on
any quirks to be aware of when using them

1) BatteryWorker.java:

      // within MainActivity.java, so `this` refers to a MainActivity instance
      // example method which would be called upon app startup
      public void appStarted() {
        ...
        BatteryWorker.TriggerBatteryWorker(this);
        ...
      }

2) SessionActivityWorker.java

      // example method which would be called upon app startup
      public void appStarted() {
        ...
        SessionActivityWorker.TriggerSessionActivityWorker("start");
        ...
      }

3) UploadWorker.java

    Example 1:
      // MainActivity.java, so `this` refers to a MainActivity instance
      // example method which would be called upon app closing
      public void appClosed() {
        ...
        UploadWorker.TriggerUploadWorker(this);
        ...
      }

    Example 2:
      // called from w/in BatteryWorker
      // push upload when battery is critically low
      @Override
      public Result doWork() {
        ...
        UploadWorker.TriggerUploadWorker(mAct);
        ...
      }

4) VideoActivityWorker.java

      // example method which would be called upon video recording start
      public void videoRecordingStarted() {
        ...
        VideoActivityWorker.TriggerVideoWorker(WorkerCommon.DataType.VID_START);
        ...
      }


5) Plugworker.java

      only called in:
        - receivers/PlugInReceiver.java
        - receivers/UnplugReceiver.java
